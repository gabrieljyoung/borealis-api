Borealis API
=====

Borealis API provides a backend interface based on Express.js and MySQL for academic course registration systems.

This project is still very much in its infancy. See [Documentation](https://github.com/gabrieljyoung/borealis-api/wiki#documentation) for an overview of features implemented so far.
